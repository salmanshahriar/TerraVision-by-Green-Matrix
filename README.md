# 🌍 TerraVision: AI-Powered Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) Monitoring

## 📌 Project Summary
Our project is an **AI-powered application** for monitoring and classifying **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)** changes using **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**.  

It tackles urgent global challenges such as unchecked urban growth, deforestation, and land degradation, which threaten biodiversity, food security, and sustainable development.

We trained an **EfficientNetB0 convolutional neural network** using **5,000 labeled Sentinel-2 RGB images from the EuroSAT dataset** across **10 land cover classes**.  
Our trained model achieved **88.3% accuracy**, allowing us to classify forests, agricultural fields, water bodies, industrial zones, and urban areas.

The application enables users to:
- Select a **region and date ranges**  
- Collect and process **RGB band images** from Sentinel-2 using **Google Earth Engine**  
- Analyze changes, generate classifications, charts, and statistics  
- Export results as **JSON or PDF reports**

By providing **near real-time monitoring**, our system supports governments, NGOs, urban planners, and researchers in taking timely action against deforestation, desertification, and unsustainable urban expansion—helping protect both ecosystems and human communities.
